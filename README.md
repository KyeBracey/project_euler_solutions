# Project Euler Solutions

Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs.
This repo will host my solutions to problems as I tackle them in my spare time.
For now, solutions will be all in Ruby, until I find a problem where I think a different language is a better tool for the job.

## Please don't ruin the fun for yourself!

The "Eureka" moment you get when you solve problems like these is wonderful, so please don't look at any of these solutions if you haven't solved them already - I don't want to be responsible to taking that experience away from you.
